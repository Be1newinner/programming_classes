# Encryption

## 2 Types of Encryption
1. One Way - Hashing
    - bcrypt ( ALGORITHM )
    - argon2 ( ALGORITHM )
    - Sha256 ( Integrity check )
    - MD5

2. Two Way
    - Symmetric Encryption
    - Asymetric Encryption


## Symmetric Encryption
    - single key that encrypt and decrypt the data
    - AES-256-CBC
    - AES-256-GCM
    - chacha20

## Asymetric Encryption
    - Two keys ( Private key and Public Key)
    - Public key encrypt data
    - Private key decrypt data
    - Public can be shared to public
    - private key should not be shared
